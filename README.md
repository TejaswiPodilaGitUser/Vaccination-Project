# Vaccination Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of global vaccination data. It aims to provide insights into vaccination trends, disease incidence, and resource allocation using data-driven approaches. The project leverages Python for data extraction and cleaning, SQL for database management, and Power BI for interactive data visualization.

The key objective is to generate actionable insights to inform public health strategies, disease prevention, and global health policy formulation.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Python scripts for cleaning and transforming vaccination and disease data.
- **SQL Database**: A structured and normalized database to store vaccination data, disease incidence, and other relevant metrics.
- **Visualization**: Use of various chart types (bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, geographical heatmaps) to analyze and visualize the data.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards for better decision-making in public health and policy formulation.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: For data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **SQL**: For structured database setup and querying.
  - MySQL (for database management)
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive data visualizations and dashboards.
